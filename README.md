A real-time dashboard for monitoring and managing a TeamSpeak 6 server via the SSH ServerQuery interface.

Built with **Node.js (Express + Socket.IO + SSH2)** on the backend.
**React + TypeScript + HeroUI + Tailwind** on the frontend.

---

## Features

- Live client list with automatic updates every few seconds
- Socket.IO real-time bridge between backend and frontend
- Modern UI built with HeroUI + TailwindCSS (Modern but empty)
- Works out of the box with any TS6 server with SSH Query enabled

---

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22+ recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) *(optional but faster than npm)*
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and the terminal

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xRiddiK/ts6-query-web-interface.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Backend

```
cd backend
npm install
or
pnpm install
```
Frontent

```
cd frontend
npm install
or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Connect the Backend to your Server
First make sure you setup your TeamSpeak 6 Server inclusive SSH login correctly.

you can test it locally via PowerShell (on Windows) with:
```
ssh -p 10022 serveradmin@<ts6-server-ip>
```
More information at
[TeamSpeak 6 Server Beta](https://github.com/teamspeak/teamspeak6-server/blob/main/CONFIG.md)

If that works you can continue with the backend.
>
In the backend folder, rename:
```
.env.example → .env
```
The .env should look like this:
```
TS_HOST=127.0.0.1
TS_PORT=10022
TS_USER=serveradmin
TS_PASS=supersecretpassword
```
(TS_PASS = query admin-password)
adjust it to your data.

The backend is now fully setup.
>
you can test it with
```
node server.js
```
Check that it’s working:
[Visit](http://localhost:8080/api/clients)

Or look into tsquery.log for activity.


### 4. Setup the Frontend (optional if you dont want to use it)
In the frontend folder, rename:
```
.env.example → .env
```
The .env should look like this:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```
If your backend runs on another host, update the URL accordingly.
>
Inside frontend/src/App.tsx, find:
```
const tsLink = "https://tmspk.gg/56zg425"; // replace with your ts link
```
Replace it with your actual TeamSpeak invite link.
>
Right-click your server → “Create Invite” → “Create” again → copy the link → paste it there.

Then start the frontend:
```
pnpm dev
or
npm run dev
```

Open the [App](http://localhost:5173/)
and you should see things
